# Introduction

This is a personal wiki that I'm building almost out of spite.
As-of 2024, I've moved to using a terminal full-time, and with this I've built
up an environment for myself that I enjoy using.
Unforfunately, this env includes various slightly off-piste tools, some of which
are pre-1.0, and this has resulted into a cascade of issues that I run into and
have to resolve.

From all of this, I've decided to build this wiki to document all of these issues
and, primarily, how I've either fixed or worked around them.
This will not be limited to just these env issues that have spured me to make this -
I have continuously run into annoying issues with many things I work with and these
will be documented the same.
While this is mostly for myself, if someone else finds this useful than maybe all this
frustration and suffering isn't all for nothing.
